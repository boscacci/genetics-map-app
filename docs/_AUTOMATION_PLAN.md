# Genetics Map: Migration Plan

**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026  
**Status:** Phases 1–3 complete. Automation pipeline runs every 4h; backup, geocoding, email notifications wired up.

**Design:** All automation runs in GitHub Actions; no local deployment steps required.

---

## 🔴 REMAINING WORK

### Completed (Phases 1–4, most of 5)
- Pipeline: Geocode → Promote → Clean → Backup → Encrypt → Build → Deploy ✅
- Admin guide, troubleshooting, system architecture, cost transfer docs ✅
- Bugs fixed: nan→Anonymous; name search (type 2+ chars); NYC alias; country #strip ✅
- Email notifications on failure only ✅

### Remaining

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Key Req 1** | Multi-lingual support | Squarespace wrapper: paid service if needed. Node map app: multi-language for filters, buttons, error messages. Survey data: no translation (display as entered). |
| **Phase 5** | Mobile UI: nav bar | Fix Squarespace/map embed so users can't accidentally lose the top nav bar on mobile |
| **Phase 5** | Map access after signup | Make it obvious how to get to the map after account creation |
| **Phase 5** | UI scrolling | Scrolling inside vs outside map area — prevent loss of context |
| **Phase 4** | Admin training | Walk through with Monisha; add screenshots to guide during session |
| **Phase 6** | Handoff | Transfer costs, final meeting, two-week monitoring |

## Scope of Work

**This section reflects what was detailed in the client contract.**

The project migrates the Genetics Map provider data management system from manual Excel-based workflows to an automated Google Sheets pipeline with GitHub Actions deployment.

**Final Deliverables:**
- Functional automated data pipeline with geocoding integration
- GitHub Actions deployment system (manual trigger + optional scheduling)
- Automated backup and email notification systems
- Administrator operations guide with screenshots and quick-reference materials
- Troubleshooting documentation and error recovery procedures
- System architecture documentation
- Cost transfer documentation (Squarespace, domain, GCP billing)
- Two-week post-launch monitoring with email support

**Additional Work (Refinements):**
- Placeholder names (e.g. "nan nan") showing on map
- Name search should not expose full list (no auto-fill)
- NYC geocoding: "New York City" should render correctly (not "NY")
- Country field artifacts (e.g. "Mexico# Test comment")
- UI: scrolling inside vs. outside map area; navigation bar visibility on mobile
- Make map access obvious after account creation

## What We're Building

A system where a **non-technical administrator can safely update provider data** in a Google Sheet, and the website automatically updates twice daily—no manual downloads, spreadsheet processing, or code changes required.

---

## Current vs. Future State

### Today (Manual Process - Takes ~2 Hours)

1. Someone sends an Excel file with provider updates
2. Developer runs data cleaning scripts locally
3. Developer uploads to Google Sheets
4. Developer runs geocoding script (adds map coordinates)
5. Developer downloads results
6. Developer commits to GitHub
7. Website rebuilds and deploys

**Problems:**
- Requires a developer for every update
- Prone to mistakes
- Slow turnaround (hours to days)

### Future (Automated - Takes Minutes)

1. Administrator edits Google Sheet directly
2. System automatically cleans, validates, and geocodes data (twice daily)
3. Website updates automatically

**Benefits:**
- No developer needed for routine updates
- Faster updates (minutes, not days)
- Built-in validation catches errors before they go live
- Change history preserved automatically

---

## Key Requirements (February 2026)

### 1. Multi-Language Support
- **Squarespace (wrapper) site:** Can use a paid service to make the wrapper more multi-lingual.
- **Node map app:** Will support multiple languages for interface elements (filters, buttons, error messages).
- **Survey data / map datapoints:** No translation. Provider names, credentials, and other survey-derived content are displayed in the language they were entered—we do not translate this data.

### 2. Safe Data Entry
Non-technical staff must be able to add providers without breaking the site:
- Use a **two-tab workflow**: "Working Copy" for edits, "Production" for live data
- Admins edit freely in Working Copy, then copy to Production when ready to publish
- Manual deployment trigger via GitHub Actions (with training for Monisha)
- Required fields enforced with sheet validation

### 3. Credential Documents
Need a place to store proof of each provider's credentials:
- Create a private Google Drive folder for credential PDFs
- Add a column in the sheet linking to each provider's credential document
- These links are admin-only (never shown publicly)

### 4. Cost Ownership Transfer
Transfer all operational costs to **Einstein Montefiore Hospital** or **Monisha**:
- Squarespace hosting
- Domain names
- Any API costs
- Document who owns logins, billing, and receives invoices

## Migration Plan: 6 Simple Phases

*Each phase addresses the **Final Deliverables**, **Key Requirements**, and **Additional Work** from the Scope above.*

### Phase 1: Set Up Google Cloud (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETE
**What:** Connect the system to Google's services  
**Tasks:**
- Create Google Cloud account ✅
- Enable Google Sheets API (for reading data) ✅
- Enable Geocoding API (for adding map coordinates) ✅
- Set up two-tab structure: "Working Copy" and "Production" ✅ (Key Req 2: Safe Data Entry)
- Share the production Google Sheet with the automation service account ✅

**Primary source of truth:** The Google Sheet is now the sole source. The `data/` folder seed data is deprecated—used only for one-time backfill. All live data flows: Working Copy (admin edits) → Production (via promote) → website (via scheduled sync).

### Phase 2: Automate Data Processing (Weeks 2-3) ✅ COMPLETE
**What:** Replace manual Excel/Jupyter workflow with automated scripts *(Deliverable: functional data pipeline with geocoding)*  
**Tasks:**
- Build script to read from Production tab in Google Sheets ✅
- Build script to clean and validate data automatically ✅ (`clean_and_validate.py`)
- Build script to geocode new addresses ✅ (`geocode_working_copy.py` in sync workflow; skips when no API key)
- Add sheet validation rules (required fields, email/URL formats) ✅
- **Credential Documents (Key Req 3):** ✅ `credential_link` column in sheet; Drive folder for credential PDFs. Excluded from public CSV.
- Test with real data ✅ (via Sync and Deploy run)

**Sync workflow:** Geocode → Promote → **Clean & validate** → Backup → Encrypt (DATA_CSV_BASE64) → Build → Deploy.

### Phase 3: Set Up GitHub Actions (Week 4) ✅ COMPLETE
**What:** Make the system run automatically AND on-demand *(Deliverables: GitHub Actions deployment, automated backup, email notifications)*  
**Tasks:**
- Configure GitHub Actions for manual triggering ✅
- Configure scheduled runs (every 4h) ✅
- Set up email notifications for workflow failures ✅ (includes workflow log attachment)
- Create automatic backups before each update ✅ (separate Drive folder; 2d/1w/3w staggered)
- Test the full automated pipeline ✅ (Sync and Deploy verified; site deploys successfully)

### Phase 4: Train Monisha on Manual Deployment (Week 5)
**What:** Enable Monisha to trigger deployments herself *(Deliverable: Administrator operations guide with screenshots)*  
**Tasks:**
- Walk through GitHub login and navigation
- Show how to trigger manual deployment (click "Run workflow")
- Explain how to read deployment status and error messages
- Practice with test data
- Create administrator operations guide with screenshots and quick-reference materials

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (Week 6)
**What:** Make sure everything works reliably *(Deliverables: troubleshooting docs, error recovery)*  
**Tasks:**
- Test two-tab workflow (Working Copy → Production)
- Test various scenarios (new providers, edits, deletions)
- Verify error handling (what happens if bad data is submitted)
- Confirm email notifications work
- **Additional Work (refinements):** Placeholder names; name search (no auto-fill); NYC geocoding; country field artifacts; UI scrolling / navigation bar; map access after signup
- Document common troubleshooting scenarios and error recovery procedures

### Phase 6: Go Live & Cost Transfer (Weeks 7-8)
**What:** Switch to the new system and finalize handoff *(Deliverables: cost transfer docs, system architecture docs, two-week monitoring)*  
**Tasks:**
- Enable scheduled automation (if desired) or keep manual-only
- Create comprehensive admin guide
- **System architecture documentation**
- **Cost transfer documentation** (Squarespace, domain, GCP billing; who owns logins, billing, and invoices) — Key Req 4
- Monitor closely for first 2 weeks (post-launch support)
- Transfer Squarespace and domain costs to Einstein/Monisha
- Final handoff meeting with Monisha

**Cross-phase: Multi-Language Support (Key Req 1):**
- Squarespace (wrapper): paid service if needed
- Node map app: multi-language for filters, buttons, error messages
- Survey data: no translation—display as entered

**Total Timeline:** 8 weeks

## How Administrators Will Use the New System

### The Two-Tab Workflow

**Working Copy Tab** = Your drafts and edits (safe zone)  
**Production Tab** = Live data that gets deployed to the website

### Adding or Editing Providers

1. Open the Google Sheet
2. Go to the **Working Copy** tab
3. Make your changes:
   - Add new rows for new providers
   - Edit existing rows to update information
   - Delete rows if needed
4. Review your changes (check for typos, required fields)
5. **Promote to Production:**
   - **Option A (Sheet Macro):** Extensions → Apps Script → Run `promoteWorkingCopyToProduction`, or use the custom menu "Genetics Map" → "Promote to Production"
   - **Option B:** Trigger **Sync and Deploy** workflow (GitHub → Actions → "Sync and Deploy" → Run workflow) — promotes, cleans, and deploys in one run
6. **Website update:** Happens automatically every 4 hours via GitHub Actions. Manual trigger: GitHub → Actions → "Sync and Deploy" → Run workflow.
7. Website updates within ~10 minutes after the sync runs

### Data Entry Tips

**Phone numbers with a plus sign (+)**  
The `phone_work` column is formatted as Plain text in both Working Copy and Production, so type international numbers directly: `+91 9502409815` or `+1-404-616-7537`.

If a copied sheet loses that formatting, run `npm run format:phones` to restore Plain text formatting before entering new phone values.

The system stores and displays all phone values as plain text—no calculations, no formatting changes. What you enter is what appears on the map.

### Why This Is Safe

- Changes in Working Copy don't affect the live site
- You can make multiple edits and review before publishing
- If something breaks, just restore Production from a backup
- Sheet validation prevents common errors (bad emails, missing required fields)

### What Happens If Something Goes Wrong

- System sends email notification with error details
- Bad data is NOT deployed (fails safely)
- Previous good version stays live
- The system can be restored from automatic backup if needed

## Security & Privacy Notes

- Provider data is **encrypted** before deploying to the website
- Only people with the secret key can view the data
- Credential documents stored in **private Google Drive** (admin access only)
- System validates data before publishing (catches email/URL errors)
- Automatic backups before every update
- Easy rollback if bad data is published

---

## Automated Sync (Every 4 Hours)

GitHub Action `sync-and-deploy` runs every 4 hours (0:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC):

1. **Geocode** Working Copy (skips when no API key) — fills missing lat/lng
2. Promote Working Copy → Production (in the sheet, with name/phone cleanup)
3. Clean and validate (pandas, reads/writes Production via Sheets API)
4. **Backup** Production to 3 separate Drive files (2d / 1w / 3w staggered)
5. Encrypt and build the React app
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Backup Safeguard (Separate Sheets in Drive Folder)

The sync workflow keeps **3 separate Google Sheet files** in a Drive folder (not tabs in the main sheet):

| File name | Updated every | Represents |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Genetics Map Backup (2 days ago) | 2 days | Production state from ~2 days ago |
| Genetics Map Backup (1 week ago) | 7 days | Production state from ~1 week ago |
| Genetics Map Backup (3 weeks ago) | 21 days | Production state from ~3 weeks ago |

- **One-time setup:** Create 3 blank sheets in your Drive folder with the exact names above; share the folder with the service account as Editor. (Service account has limited Drive quota; user-created files use your quota.)
- **BACKUP_FOLDER_ID** secret: Drive folder ID
- Script updates existing files only; populates empty sheets on first run
- Main sheet stays simple: Working Copy + Production only

**GitHub secrets** (see `docs/SETUP.md`): `GCP_SA_KEY`, `SHEET_ID`, `REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY`, `BACKUP_FOLDER_ID`, `GEOCODING_API_KEY`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`

## Sheet Macro: Promote to Production

A Google Apps Script macro lives in the sheet (Extensions → Apps Script). It performs the same promote logic as the Sync and Deploy workflow:
- Copies Working Copy → Production
- Applies name cleanup (title-case, Dr. normalization, nan → Anonymous Contributor)
- Fixes corrupted phone cells using Production as fallback
- Sanitizes formula-dangerous characters (=, +, -, @)

**To add the macro:** Copy `scripts/promote.gs` into the sheet's Apps Script editor, save, and run `onOpen` once to install the custom menu.
